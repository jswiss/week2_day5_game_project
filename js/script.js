var level2ParaArray = ['Twenty or thirty years ago my story was in great demand. But in these days nobody seems interested- There you go! Hare-Lip cried hotly. Cut out the funny stuff and talk sensible. Whats interested? You talk like a baby that dont know how. Let him alone, Edwin urged, or hell get mad and wont talk at all.  Skip the funny places. Well catch on to some of what he tells us. Let her go, Granser, Hoo-Hoo encouraged; for the old man was already maundering about the disrespect for elders and the reversion to cruelty of all humans that fell from high culture to primitive conditions. The tale began. There were very many people in the world in those days. San Francisco alone held four millions- What is millions? Edwin interrupted. Granser looked at him kindly. I know you cannot count beyond ten, so I will tell you. Hold up your  two hands. On both of them you have altogether ten fingers and thumbs.  Very well. I now take this grain of sand-you hold it, Hoo-Hoo. He  dropped the grain of sand into the lads palm and went on. Now that  grain of sand stands for the ten fingers of Edwin. I add another grain.  Thats ten more fingers. And I add another, and another, and another,  until I have added as many grains as Edwin has fingers and thumbs. That  makes what I call one hundred. Remember that word-one hundred. Now I  put this pebble in Hare-Lips hand. It stands for ten grains of sand, or  ten tens of fingers, or one hundred fingers. I put in ten pebbles. They  stand for a thousand fingers. I take a mussel-shell, and it stands for  ten pebbles, or one hundred grains of sand, or one thousand fingers....', 'Who can tell? he rejoined.  They may constitute the link between ape and man, all traces of which have been swallowed by the countless convulsions which have racked the outer crust, or they may be merely the result of evolution along slightly different lines-either is quite possible. Further speculation was interrupted by the appearance of several of our captors before the entrance of the hut.  Two of them entered and dragged us forth.  The perilous pathways and the surrounding trees were filled with the black ape-men, their females, and their young.  There was not an ornament, a weapon, or a garment among the lot. Quite low in the scale of creation, commented Perry. Quite high enough to play the deuce with us, though, I replied.  Now what do you suppose they intend doing with us? We were not long in learning.  As on the occasion of our trip to the village we were seized by a couple of the powerful creatures and whirled away through the tree tops, while about us and in our wake raced a chattering, jabbering, grinning horde of sleek, black ape-things. Twice my bearers missed their footing, and my heart ceased beating as we plunged toward instant death among the tangled deadwood beneath.', 'The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railing put up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior. I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed to find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the six oclock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to waylay him. When I returned to the common the sun was setting.  Scattered groups were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were returning.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people, perhaps.', 'Keep back! said several. The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit. I say! said Ogilvy; help keep these idiots back.  We dont know whats in the confounded thing, you know! I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed him in. The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my eyes. I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.', 'You are a wicked creature! cried Dorothy.  You have no right to take my shoe from me. I shall keep it, just the same, said the Witch, laughing at her, and someday I shall get the other one from you, too. This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot. Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away. See what you have done! she screamed.  In a minute I shall melt away. Im very sorry, indeed, said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes. Didnt you know water would be the end of me? asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice. Of course not, answered Dorothy.  How should I? Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself.  I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds.', 'Dad says that the wife of the first Chauffeur was a lady- Whats a lady? Hoo-Hoo demanded. A lady s a Chauffeur squaw, was the quick reply of Hare-Lip. The first Chauffeur was Bill, a common fellow, as I said before, the old man expounded; but his wife was a lady, a great lady. Before the Scarlet Death she was the wife of Van Worden. He was President of the Board of Industrial Magnates, and was one of the dozen men who ruled America. He was worth one billion, eight hundred millions of dollars-coins like you have there in your pouch, Edwin. And then came the Scarlet Death, and his wife became the wife of Bill, the first Chauffeur. He used to beat her, too. I have seen it myself. Hoo-Hoo, lying on his stomach and idly digging his toes in the sand, cried out and investigated, first, his toe-nail, and next, the small hole he had dug. The other two boys joined him, excavating the sand rapidly with their hands till there lay three skeletons exposed. Two were of adults, the third being that of a part-grown child.', 'But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out&mdash;a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him. The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings. Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship', 'Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist, and handed them to the beggar, saying, Here, my good woman.  Im glad that I met you; and passed on. Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his masters action touched his susceptible heart. Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased, Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train, when he perceived his five friends of the Reform. Well, gentlemen, said he, Im off, you see; and, if you will examine my passport when I get back, you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon. Oh, that would be quite unnecessary, Mr. Fogg, said Ralph politely. We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honour. You do not forget when you are due in London again?  asked Stuart. In eighty days; on Saturday, the 21st of December, 1872, at a quarter before nine p.m.  Good-bye, gentlemen. Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle screamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station. The night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling.  Phileas Fogg, snugly ensconced in his corner, did not open his lips.', 'Well, answered Oz, if it were inside of you, it would be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it.  Therefore, I advise you to drink it as soon as possible. The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty. How do you feel now? asked Oz. Full of courage, replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune. Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted.  How can I help being a humbug, he said, when all these people make me do things that everybody knows cant be done?  It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything.  But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and Im sure I dont know how it can be done. For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz.  These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented.  The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself.', 'Things have changed, I said, quietly.  You must keep your head. There is still hope. Hope! Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction! I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at first, but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare, and his regard wandered from me. This must be the beginning of the end, he said, interrupting me. The end!  The great and terrible day of the Lord!  When men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne! I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his shoulder. Be a man! said I.  You are scared out of your wits!  What good is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did you think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is not an insurance agent. For a time he sat in blank silence. But how can we escape? he asked, suddenly.  They are invulnerable, they are pitiless. Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other, I answered.'];
